# Pizza Sales Analytics with Excel and SQL

## Introduction 
Welcome to an immersive journey into Python data analysis, with a focus on the exciting world of Netflix. In this project, we are going to dive into the massive Netflix dataset, uncovering its vast collection of movies and television shows. You'll master Python's powerful data analysis capabilities through practical application and hands-on exploration, revealing invaluable insights and demonstrating trends hidden within the Netflix dataset.

With Python as our tool of choice, we'll embark on an inspiring exploration of the Netflix dataset, addressing a number of questions and challenges along the way. This project promises to equip you with a strong understand of data analysis techniques by separating the distribution of content across various groups and types, reviewing viewer ratings, and release dates.

### Problem Statement:

In this project, our primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset using Python, aiming to extract actionable insights and address pertinent questions. The dataset encompasses a wealth of information regarding various movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform, including essential details such as title, release year, category, genre, rating, and more.

Our mission is to navigate through a series of questions and tasks, leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities to unearth valuable insights. These questions encompass a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from investigating the distribution of content across different categories and genres to discerning trends in viewer preferences and ratings.

   - `head()`, `tail()`: To display the first or last few rows of the dataset.
   - `shape`: To get the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
   - `info()`: To get information about the dataset, including data types and missing values.
   - `describe()`: To generate descriptive statistics of numerical columns.
   - `value_counts()`: To count unique values in a column.
   - `groupby()`: To group data based on certain criteria.
   - `apply()`: To apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame.
   - `sort_values()`: To sort the DataFrame by specific columns.
   - `drop_duplicates()`: To remove duplicate rows from the DataFrame.
   - `isnull()`, `notnull()`: To check for missing values in the dataset.
   - `fillna()`: To fill missing values with specified values.

2. **Matplotlib and Seaborn Functions:**
   - `plt.bar()`, `plt.hist()`, `plt.scatter()`: To create various types of plots.
   - `sns.countplot()`, `sns.barplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`: To create categorical plots.
   - `sns.heatmap()`: To visualize missing values using a heatmap.

3. **String Manipulation Functions:**
   - `str.contains()`: To check if a string contains a specified substring.
   - `str.split()`: To split a string into substrings based on a delimiter.

4. **Datetime Functions:**
   - `pd.to_datetime()`: To convert string dates to datetime objects.
   - `dt.year`, `dt.month`, `dt.day`: To extract year, month, and day from datetime objects.

5. **Other Functions:**
   - `max()`, `min()`: To find the maximum and minimum values.
   - `unique()`, `nunique()`: To get unique values and the count of unique values in a column.

These functions have been instrumental in performing various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks on the Netflix dataset using Python.
